GSA-Video-Project
=================

The repo contains about 8-9 small After Effects files which I have built myself. Built as a video project for 
Google Student Ambassador Application. 

The video primarily contains the use of Kinetic Typography, and some crazy bits of myself. 

If you're planning to use it as a template, do mention me clearly at the end of your project.
If it's on Youtube, share a link to my video. And make the credits stay for atleast 2 seconds.

You are not allowed to use it without the above criteria being satisfied.
